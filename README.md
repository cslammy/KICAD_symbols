# KICAD_symbols
Custom/modified/unusual symbols I use in my Kicad projects.

If you are doing NGspice simulations, some symbols here need models--get them from this repo: https://github.com/cslammy/spice_models
Save the spice model file on your HD, then edit the symbol file (edit > symbol properties) to point the symbol to the .lib file.
